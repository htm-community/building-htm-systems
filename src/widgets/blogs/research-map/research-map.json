		"desc": "<img src=\"img/classic-hierarchy-vs-proposed-model.png\" /> <p> The <strong>Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence</strong> proposes that the brain is composed of thousands of copies of a common cortical circuit. Each copy of the circuit (or cortical column) builds many distributed models of each object or concept learned through movement and sensation.  Each model is built in a different way – with different inputs from different senses, or from different parts of the same sense.  Cortical columns use long range connections to vote and reach a consensus on what they are sensing. </p> <p> It’s as if your brain is thousands of brains working simultaneously. </p> <p> The Thousand Brains Theory suggests we need to rethink how the cortex processes information.  Rather than extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, where objects are only recognized at the top, the theory instead suggests a highly distributed sensory-motor system. </p>\n",

Long-range connections in the cortex allow columns to vote and this parallel voting leads to a consensus of what they the columns are sensing. </p>\n",

			"Common Cortical Circuit": {
				"desc": "<img src=\"img/cortical-circuit.png\" /> <p> The neocortex is complex. It contains dozens of cell types, numerous layers, and intricate connectivity patterns. The connections between cells suggest a columnar flow of information across layers as well as a laminar flow within some layers. Fortunately, this complex circuitry is remarkably preserved in all regions. Vernon Mountcastle was the first to propose that a canonical circuit consisting of cortical columns underlies everything the neocortex does. The way we see, feel, hear, move, and even do high level planning runs on this same common cortical circuit. </p>\n<p> If we can understand how this <strong>common cortical circuit</strong> works, we will have a framework for understanding how the entire neocortex works. Understanding the function of cortical columns is a central goal of our research program. </p>\n",
