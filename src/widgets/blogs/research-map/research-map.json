		"desc": "<img src=\"img/classic-hierarchy-vs-proposed-model.png\" /> <p> The <strong>Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence</strong> proposes that rather than learning one model of an object or concept, the brain builds many models of the same thing. Each model is built in a different way – with different types of inputs from different senses or from different parts of the same sensors. The models vote together to reach a consensus on what they are sensing, and the consensus vote is what we perceive. It’s as if your brain is thousands of brains working simultaneously. </p> <p> The Thousand Brains Theory suggests we need to rethink how the cortex processes information.  Rather than extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, where objects are recognized as you ascend the hierarchy, our theory suggests a more distributed model. </p>\n",

Columns combine sensory input with a grid cell-derived location, and then integrate those “sensory features at locations” over movements. Long-range connections in the cortex allow columns to vote and this parallel voting leads to a consensus of what they the columns are sensing. </p>\n",

			"Common Cortical Circuit": {
				"desc": "<img src=\"img/cortical-circuit.png\" /> <p> The neocortex is complex. It contains dozens of cell types, numerous layers, and intricate connectivity patterns. The connections between cells suggest a columnar flow of information across layers as well as a laminar flow within some layers. Fortunately, this complex circuitry is remarkably preserved in all regions. Vernon Mountcastle was the first to propose that a canonical circuit consisting of cortical columns underlies everything the neocortex does. The way we see, feel, hear, move, and even do high level planning runs on this same common cortical circuit. </p>\n<p> If we can understand how this <strong>common cortical circuit</strong> works, we will have a framework for understanding how the entire neocortex works. Understanding the function of cortical columns is a central goal of our research program. </p>\n",
